# Anomaly Detection

Anomaly detection is the process of identifying data points that deviate significantly from the expected or normal
behavior of a dataset. These data points are often referred to as anomalies, outliers, or novelties.

Anomaly detection is commonly used in various fields, such as fraud detection, intrusion detection, fault detection, and
predictive maintenance, among others. The goal of anomaly detection is to identify unusual or suspicious events that
could indicate a problem or opportunity.

There are different methods for anomaly detection, including statistical methods, machine learning techniques, and
rule-based approaches. Statistical methods typically rely on defining a threshold or range of expected behavior and
flagging data points that fall outside of this range as anomalies. Machine learning methods can learn the expected
behavior of a dataset and detect deviations from it. Rule-based approaches use predefined rules to identify anomalies
based on specific criteria.

Overall, anomaly detection is a useful technique for identifying unusual  events in a dataset and can help
improve decision-making and prevent potential problems.

In this context, an 'unusual' event is a buy or sell indication, which would typically occur only 1-2% of the time
